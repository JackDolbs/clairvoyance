# Clairvoyance Deployment Status Report
February 6, 2025

## What We've Accomplished
1. Created multi-platform Docker image
   - Successfully builds for both ARM64 (Mac) and AMD64 (VPS)
   - Image pushed to Docker Hub: `jackdolbs/clairvoyance:latest`
   - Container runs locally without issues

2. Simplified application
   - Removed version display from config page
   - Streamlined PocketBase status monitoring

## Current Issues
1. 502 Bad Gateway on VPS Deployment
   - Frontend (Vite) not accessible through Traefik
   - Container starts but service unreachable
   - Occurs despite correct port bindings (5174)

2. Deployment Environment
   - Running through Coolify infrastructure
   - Using Traefik for reverse proxy
   - Container labels configured for routing

## Attempted Solutions
1. Port Configuration
   - Tried different port mappings
   - Verified services running inside container
   - Confirmed Vite binding to 0.0.0.0:5174

2. Container Configuration
   - Updated start.sh for better network binding
   - Verified process management
   - Tested different Traefik routing rules

## Next Steps to Investigate
1. Verify Vite production build settings
2. Check Traefik logs for routing issues
3. Consider alternative port configurations
4. Review Vite's compatibility with reverse proxies

## Working Components
- Docker image builds successfully
- Container runs locally
- PocketBase initializes correctly
- Multi-platform support works

## Non-Working Components
- VPS deployment through Coolify
- Frontend access through Traefik
- Production environment routing
